Passwords : APPLIED | AWS TLS Private KEy
Implement strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including the administrator. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid sharing accounts.

Updates :
Regularly apply security patches, bug fixes, and updates to the server's software, applications, and operating system.

Firewalls : APPLIED - Security Group | NACL
Configure a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic, and only allow necessary connections. Consider internal firewalls for additional protection.

Authentication :
Use two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to increase security.

Backups :
Regularly back up your server, and store the backups in a secure location separate from your primary data storage. Encrypt the data during the backup process.

Monitoring :
Monitor your system for anomalies, malicious login attempts, and unauthorized data access.

Software :
Remove unnecessary services, protocols, and software modules. Disable unused services and daemons.

Access control :
Limit superuser or root access. Implement a security plan for physical access to the server.

Separation :
Keep database servers separate from application servers. Hosting both on the same server is considered a single point of failure.

VPNs : APPLIED
Use VPNs and private networks to provide a secure channel for accessing the enterprise network.

Software updates :
Regularly update the server's operating system, content management system, and plugins to address known vulnerabilities.

Log analysis :
Automate log analysis and aggregate log files from all your servers into a centralized repository.
